    <h3>What I'm Studying</h3>
    <p> I am currently learning how to code at Launchcode. Along with that I am also pursuing a information systems degree. I will be finishing my associates degree at
      Stlcc - Forest Park. <br> I also attempt to learn on my own for a lot of subjects. Before taking the launchcode course, I began looking up how to write in Java and C++. I also have taken
      Coursera courses for data science and the coding language R. Over the summer I concurrently took classes towards my buisness degree as well as an online course on algorithms and data structure.<br>
      My current area of study aside from what I mentioned above, is game theory and design.</p>

    <h3>What My Interests Are</h3>
    <p> First of all, I am a hardcore gamer. In the last year I have probably put in 3000 hours of game play into three games. Along with games I also have a passion for creating anything.<br>
       Over the summer I built two different things. Using my wood working skills I built a bed side table for my room. </p>

      <p> I also built some a drone using a raspberry pi as a flight controller but I flew it into a lake..... <br>
        As for coding, I am working on my own game for android (and iphone) as well as my own financial manager. Links for those will come in the future.<br>
        Outside of the tech, I really love to play badminton. </p>

    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p> One of my most favorite games to play is called League of Legends. The studio/creator of that game is Riot Games and they just happen to have an office in Clayton. So, my current dream job is to
      work for them. One of my long term goals is to open my own software development firm/game studio. After I gain some experience working for companies I want start my own. I have an elaborate vision for this company
      that would take too long to explain. My hope is that I can travel along that vision and make at least a part of it come true.
