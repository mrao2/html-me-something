    <h3>What I'm Studying</h3>
    <p> I am currently learning how to code at Launchcode. Along with that I am also pursuing a information systems degree. I will be finishing my associates degree at
      Stlcc - Forest Park. <br> I also attempt to learn on my own for a lot of subjects. Before taking the launchcode course, I began looking up how to write in Java and C++. I also have taken
      Coursera courses for data science and the coding language R. Over the summer I concurrently took classes towards my buisness degree as well as an online course on algorithms and data structure.<br>
      My current area of study aside from what I mentioned above, is game theory and design.
